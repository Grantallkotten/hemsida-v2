    "description": "This project was my introduction to 3D modeling, and I had to learn Blender from scratch. My primary focus was the robot itself, but I also did a lot of work with the mountain cliff and its surrounding details. I started with basic shapes, using simple geometry to build a solid, functional design. The body began as a cylinder, with rectangular blocks for the limbs. After the main structure was complete, I refined the model by adding details like lamps and components to give it a more industrial, futuristic feel. The design aimed for simplicity with an advanced edge, resembling a robot from a futuristic military force. Finally, blood spatters were added to the metal textures, suggesting a darker backstory."

  "description": "This Blender project marked my first experience with 3D modeling, where I, and two auther team members, created a dramatic scene featuring a robot perched on a snow-covered mountain peak. The main focus was split between crafting the rugged mountain landscape and designing the robot itself. I began with basic geometric shapes to form the robot's structure, refining it with intricate details like lamps and mechanical components to give it a futuristic, military feel. The scene was further enriched by a weathered door placed beside the robot, adding an element of mystery. To convey a darker backstory, I applied blood spatters to the robot's metal surface, hinting at a violent or tragic event. The heavy snowfall and moody lighting were crucial in setting the tone, creating a tense and atmospheric environment. This project was a major step in learning Blender and 3D design, allowing me to explore both technical and creative challenges.",

Heavy snowfall blankets the scene, enhancing the dramatic and desolate atmosphere. Blood stains on the robotâ€™s metallic surface hint at a violent, mysterious past, adding depth and tension to the already intense setting."
